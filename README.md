## Usage

Take a newsletter such as [The AI Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7025619738558926848/)

Notice the URL looks something like: `https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7025619738558926848/`

The last bit (`7025619738558926848`) is the newsletter ID.

Giving you an address like [`https://linkedinrss.cns.me/7025619738558926848`](https://linkedinrss.cns.me/7025619738558926848)

Put that into your favorite RSS reader and make yourself a coffee â˜• all your LinkedIn newsletters will be available in your RSS feed now!

## You can of course deploy this to your own Cloudflare worker config.
